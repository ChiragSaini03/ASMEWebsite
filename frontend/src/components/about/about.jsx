ASME is a non-profit organisation that helps engineering community to develop solutions for real world challenges since 1880. I wish having the student section of such a organisation will surely make the students exposed to latest advancements in the field of engineering and will also make them out into a personality that will help in the growing needs of the society. With so many years of experience in the field of engineering i would say that these kind of organisations not only helps the students grow technically but also incorporate in them the sense of responsibility and management. I wish members of the section to take the initiative and take the institute to the new benchmarks of excellence. I ensure institute will always accompany them in their success paths.',

During such a short duration, the department has come to a stage that a student chapter of internationally reputed ASME has been formed with great hope and optimism. This was possible due to the passion, enthusiasm, hardworking of the students and the faculty members and the motivation by the Director. A very popular saying goes, “when the going gets tough the tough gets going”. The ASME student chapter is quite conclusively a community of the students, for the students and by the students which primarily aims to equip the students with all the artillery required to sustain the engaging warfare and cutthroat antagonism of industrial and corporate world.

The student team have shown enthusiasm in taking up projects and organizing workshops. The Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering Department at LNMIIT has well equiped CAD lab with designing and computational software such as Solidworks, Ansys, MSC, Auto Desk, Robo Analyzer, VI-Rail and Matlab. The fabrication facilities in the workshop boasts of industrial grade machine tools such as vertical machining centre (VMC), plasma cutting machine, 3-D printing machine and Fanuc-make welding robot.The department has also set up state of the art NI Lab and Robotics Lab. Using the extensive infrastructure available, the ASME student chapter at LNMIIT endeavors to promote extensive engineering design and fabrication skills dedicated to create innovative solutions in the field of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering.
